# vehicle
In this assignment, I learned how to analyze requirements and design a class in C++ by applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The first step was to identify the main entity, which is the Vehicle. From the requirements, I defined its essential attributes such as type and maxSpeed. To improve the design and make the class more realistic, I also added extra attributes like fuelType, weight, and capacity. This extension not only makes the class closer to real-world vehicles but also helps me understand the importance of modeling with sufficient details.

I implemented both constructors and getter/setter methods to control how data is accessed and modified. This practice strengthened my understanding of encapsulation, which is one of the four core principles of OOP. I also created behaviors such as accelerate() and display(). The accelerate() method shows how behavior can represent real-world actions, while the display() method helps in presenting information in a clear way.

During the process, I recognized that designing a class requires balancing between simplicity and completeness. Too few attributes may not fully represent the entity, while too many can make the class unnecessarily complex. Another challenge was ensuring that user input could be integrated correctly into the object creation process. By solving this, I gained more confidence in handling constructors and user interaction in C++.

Overall, this exercise gave me practical experience in defining classes, applying encapsulation, and connecting theory with practice. It also improved my problem-solving and coding skills, which are essential for further OOP learning.
